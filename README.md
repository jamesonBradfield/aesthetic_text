# aesthetic_text
aesthetic_text in neovim using nerdfonts. The idea of this plugin is to enable easy ![Aesthetic text using nerdfonts](./screenshots/aesthetic_text.png) text.

this plugin is currently a proof of concept and only has one style of text, I would love feedback and suggestions on how to make this better!
